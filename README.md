## Using The Design System

The design system can be thought about in two layers: the visual and the interface layers. 

**Interaction Layer:** The flow for how someone completes a task.

**Interface Layer:** The components of a website or app. These are well-established, scalable patterns. 

**Visual Layer:** The skin of a website or app. This layer is thematic, can change annually, seasonally, or for one-off occasions. Anything on this layer can be modified without affecting the interface layer.
